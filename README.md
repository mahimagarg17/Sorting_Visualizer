# Sorting_Visualizer
 I built this application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. These algorithms can be better understood through visualization.
The code along with the exe file has been uploaded here. The exe file(sortingvisualizer_app) can be downloaded to run this application on your pc.
